## Implementation Complete

EventBusService integration has been successfully implemented across the entire cannabis booking management platform, establishing a comprehensive microservices event-driven architecture.

## Key Accomplishments

- Equipment and kit management events
- Location and availability management events

### 3. Production-Ready Architecture

- UUID-based entity tracking across all events
- Correlation ID support for cross-service communication
- In-memory event store ready for Redis/RabbitMQ deployment
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

### 4. Documentation Updated

- Updated all microservices architecture documentation
- Created comprehensive implementation guides
