# Build Optimization Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for optimizing the build process and preventing common issues like chunk load errors that can occur during deployment.

## ChunkLoadError Prevention

The application has experienced ChunkLoadError issues during deployment, which typically occur when JavaScript chunks fail to load. Here are strategies to prevent these errors:

### 1. Optimize Webpack Configuration

In `next.config.mjs`, we've updated the webpack configuration to optimize chunk generation:

```javascript
webpack: (config) => {
  // Optimize chunk size
  config.optimization.splitChunks = {
    chunks: "all",
    maxInitialRequests: 25,
    minSize: 20000,
    maxSize: 200000,
    cacheGroups: {
      default: false,
      vendors: false,
      commons: {
        name: "commons",
        chunks: "all",
        minChunks: 2,
        reuseExistingChunk: true,
      },
      lib: {
        test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
        name(module) {
          const packageName = module.context.match(
            /[\\/]node_modules[\\/](.*?)([\\/]|$)/,
          )[1];
          return `npm.${packageName.replace("@", "")}`;
        },
        chunks: "all",
        priority: 1,
        reuseExistingChunk: true,
      },
    },
  };

  return config;
};
```

This configuration:

- Limits the maximum size of generated chunks to prevent large downloads
- Groups common code into shared chunks
- Creates separate chunks for third-party libraries

### 2. Optimized Production Build Scripts

We've created optimized build scripts with increased memory allocation to prevent build failures:

- `optimized-production-build.sh`: Uses increased Node.js memory limits
- `ultra-minimal-build.sh`: Creates a minimal build for testing

### 3. Lazy Loading Components

Use dynamic imports to lazy load components that aren't immediately needed:

```javascript
// Instead of
import HeavyComponent from "@/components/HeavyComponent";

// Use
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import("@/components/HeavyComponent"), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
});
```

### 4. Implementing Retry Logic for Chunk Loading

Add client-side retry logic for chunk loading failures:

```javascript
// Add to a global script
window.addEventListener("error", function (event) {
  if (event.message && event.message.includes("ChunkLoadError")) {
    console.log("Chunk failed to load, retrying...");
    window.location.reload();
  }
});
```

## Memory Optimization

The build process can be memory-intensive. We've implemented several strategies:

### 1. Increased Node.js Heap Size

Build scripts now include increased memory allocation:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=3072" next build
```

### 2. Optimized Build Configurations

Different build configurations have been created for various scenarios:

- `optimized-production-build.sh`: Full optimized build with increased memory
- `minimal-production-build.sh`: Minimal build for testing
- `staged-build.sh`: Multi-stage build process to reduce memory usage

## Deployment Verification

To ensure deployments work as expected:

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checks

Run the `deployment-checklist.sh` script before deployment to verify:

- Database connectivity
- Production environment variables
- Build compatibility

### 2. Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:

- Middleware functionality
- Database access
- Chunk loading in production environment

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

When chunk load errors occur:

1. Check network requests in the browser console for specific failing chunks
2. Analyze the webpack build stats to identify problematic dependencies
3. Consider implementing a service worker for more reliable asset caching
4. Add monitoring for client-side errors with proper logging

By following these guidelines, you can minimize the risk of chunk load errors and other build-related issues in production deployments.
