# Staging Architecture Compliance Report

## Executive Summary

❌ **Staging is NOT following the prescribed Next.js static with serverless microservices and event bus architecture**

## Current State Analysis

### 1. Next.js Static Export Configuration ❌

**Current Configuration (next.config.mjs):**
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  // Development mode deployment - no static export
  // This avoids the build hanging issue
  
  // Missing: output: "export" for static export
  // Missing: Serverless configuration
  // Missing: Azure Functions compatibility
```

**Prescribed Architecture Requirements:**
- `output: "export"` for static export
- Serverless Functions configuration
- Azure Static Web Apps optimization
- Bundle optimization for 244KB limits

### 2. EventBusService Integration ❌

**Current Implementation Issues:**

**Organizations API Route:**
```typescript
// Line 2: Imports EventBusService but never uses it
import { EventBusService } from "../../../services/event-bus-service";
// Missing: Event publishing for organization queries
// Missing: Service layer pattern
```

**Locations API Route:**
```typescript
// Line 2: Imports EventBusService but never uses it  
import { EventBusService } from "../../../services/event-bus-service";
// Missing: Event publishing for location operations
// Missing: Service layer pattern
```

**Bookings API Route:**
```typescript
// Missing: EventBusService import entirely
// Missing: Event publishing for booking operations
// Missing: Service layer pattern
```

### 3. Microservices Architecture ❌

**Current Pattern (Non-Compliant):**
```
Request → Authentication → Direct Database Access → Response
```

**Prescribed Pattern (Missing):**
```
Request → Authentication → Validation → Service Layer → Event Publishing → Response
```

**Missing Components:**
- Service layer abstraction
- Event publishing for all state changes
- Microservices communication patterns
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Health monitoring

### 4. UUID-Based Entity Tracking ⚠️

**Current State:**
- UUIDs used inconsistently across entities
- Some mock data still uses non-UUID identifiers
- Event correlation IDs not implemented

## Documentation vs Implementation Gap

### What Documentation Claims (✅)
- "EventBusService integration has been successfully implemented across the entire cannabis booking management platform"
- "All API routes now implement the consistent pattern: authentication → validation → service layer → event publishing → response"
- "Complete microservices architecture now deployable to Azure Static Web Apps"

### What Implementation Shows (❌)
- EventBusService imported but not used
- No service layer implementation
- No event publishing in API routes
- Development mode instead of static export
- Direct database access instead of microservices

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Build Configuration Issue
- Current: Development mode to avoid "build hanging issue"
- Required: Static export with serverless functions
- Impact: Cannot deploy as serverless microservices

### 2. Architecture Pattern Mismatch
- Current: Monolithic API route pattern
- Required: Microservices with event-driven communication
- Impact: Not following prescribed architecture

### 3. EventBusService Not Utilized
- Current: Imported but unused across all API routes
- Required: Event publishing for all state changes
- Impact: No audit trails or microservices communication

### 4. Missing Service Layer
- Current: Direct database access in API routes
- Required: Service layer abstraction with dependency injection
- Impact: Tight coupling and non-scalable architecture

## Recommendations for Compliance

### Phase 1: Fix Next.js Configuration
1. Update `next.config.mjs` to use `output: "export"`
2. Add bundle optimization for Azure Functions
3. Configure webpack for 244KB chunk limits
4. Add serverless compatibility settings

### Phase 2: Implement Service Layer
1. Create service classes for each domain (BookingService, LocationService, etc.)
2. Implement dependency injection pattern
3. Add circuit breaker and health monitoring
4. Abstract database access through service layer

### Phase 3: EventBusService Integration
1. Implement event publishing in all API routes
2. Add correlation IDs for event tracking
3. Create event subscribers for cross-service communication
4. Implement audit trail functionality

### Phase 4: Microservices Architecture
1. Restructure API routes to follow microservices pattern
2. Implement authentication → validation → service → event → response flow
3. Add proper error handling and graceful degradation
4. Configure for Azure Functions deployment

## Conclusion

**Current Status:** Development mode with direct database access
**Required Status:** Static export with serverless microservices and event bus
**Compliance Level:** ~20% compliant

The staging environment needs significant architectural changes to align with the prescribed Next.js static with serverless microservices and event bus architecture.
