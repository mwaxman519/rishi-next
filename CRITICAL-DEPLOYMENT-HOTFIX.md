# CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT HOTFIX - PRODUCTION AUTH FIX

## Root Cause Identified
The database connection logic was failing because:
1. `process.env.NODE_ENV` and `process.env.VERCEL_ENV` might not be set as expected on Vercel
2. The conditional logic was too restrictive
3. Need bulletproof detection for Vercel production environment

## Fix Applied
Updated `app/api/auth-service/utils/db-connection.ts` with:
1. Enhanced environment variable logging
2. Bulletproof Vercel production detection
3. Multiple fallback conditions
4. Clear production database URL forcing

## Key Changes
- Added comprehensive environment detection logging
- Added `process.env.VERCEL` detection
- Added hostname-based detection as fallback
- Force production database URL for any Vercel deployment

## Test Status
✅ Production database connection verified
✅ User 'mike' exists in production database
✅ Enhanced logging added for debugging

## Next Steps
1. Deploy this fix to Vercel immediately
2. Test authentication with enhanced logging
3. Monitor logs for exact environment variable values

**DEPLOY NOW** - This should resolve the authentication issue.
