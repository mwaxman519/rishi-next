## ðŸš€ RECOMMENDED APPROACH: PWA + VoltBuilder

### Phase 1: PWA Distribution (Immediate, Free)
**What you already have:**
- Your Rishi Platform is already a PWA
- Deployed on Vercel and working
- Users can install directly from browser

**How users install:**
1. Visit your Vercel URL on their phone
2. Browser shows "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. App installs like native app
4. Works offline, has push notifications

**Benefits:**
- Zero additional cost
- Instant distribution
- Automatic updates
- Works on both iOS and Android

### Phase 2: Native Builds (If Needed)
**Use VoltBuilder for cloud builds:**
- Cost: $15/month (first 15 days free)
- Builds both iOS and Android
- No Mac required
- Direct APK/IPA download

## ðŸ“‹ RECOMMENDATION

**For your situation:**
1. **Start with PWA** - you already have this
2. **Add VoltBuilder** if you need native features
3. **Use Firebase** for organized distribution
4. **Consider Apple Enterprise** only if iOS sideloading is critical

**Total monthly cost: $15 (VoltBuilder) + $25/month (Apple Enterprise annual)**

This is much cheaper than the discontinued Appflow and gives you full control over distribution.
