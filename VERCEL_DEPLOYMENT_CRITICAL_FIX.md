# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT CRITICAL FIX

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
Production deployment is still using cached environment variables pointing to "rishinext" database instead of "rishiapp_prod".

## IMMEDIATE FIX APPLIED
Modified auth service db-connection.ts to force production database URL when:
1. NODE_ENV === "production" 
2. VERCEL_ENV === "production"
3. DATABASE_URL contains "rishinext"

## FORCED DATABASE URL
```
postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_UgTA70PJweka@ep-jolly-cherry-a8pw3fqw-pooler.eastus2.azure.neon.tech/rishiapp_prod?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
```

## STATUS
Ready for immediate deployment - this will force production authentication to use correct database.

## VERIFICATION
After deployment, login with mike/wrench519 should work immediately.
