# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Issues Fixed

## ✅ Build Error Resolution

### Issue 1: Missing @db Webpack Alias
**Problem**: 63 API routes importing from `@db` but webpack configuration missing the alias
**Solution**: Added `@db` alias to webpack configuration in `next.config.mjs`

```javascript
'@db': path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'db'),
```

### Issue 2: Module Resolution Inconsistency
**Problem**: TypeScript config had `@db` alias but webpack config didn't
**Solution**: Synchronized both configurations for consistent module resolution

## 🔍 Files Affected
- **next.config.mjs**: Added missing `@db` webpack alias
- **63 API routes**: Now properly resolve database imports
- **tsconfig.json**: Already had correct `@db` configuration

## 📋 Database Import Structure
```
@db → ./db.ts → ./app/lib/db-connection.ts → Neon Database
```

## 🎯 Expected Results
- All 63 API routes with `@db` imports now resolve correctly
- Build process completes successfully
- Vercel deployment proceeds without module resolution errors
- Database connections work properly in serverless functions

## 🚀 Deployment Status
✅ **Import path issues resolved**
✅ **Webpack configuration synchronized**
✅ **Module resolution fixed**
✅ **Ready for Vercel deployment**

Push the updated `next.config.mjs` to GitHub and Vercel will automatically rebuild with resolved dependencies.
