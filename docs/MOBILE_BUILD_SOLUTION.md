# Mobile Build Solution - React Router Compatibility Issue

## Problem Identified
React Router DOM works in desktop browsers but fails in mobile WebView environments (Capacitor). The `Routes` component becomes undefined when destructured, despite the library loading successfully.

**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Routes')`

## Root Cause Analysis
- React Router library loads successfully in mobile WebView
- All exports are available in `window.ReactRouterDOM`
- However, when destructuring components like `{ Routes, Route }`, they become undefined
- This is a mobile WebView specific compatibility issue, not a version problem

## Working Solution
**State-Based Navigation System** - Implemented in `test-6-router-fixed/`:

### Navigation Architecture
```javascript
const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState('dashboard');

const pages = {
    dashboard: Dashboard,
    bookings: Bookings,
    staff: Staff,
    locations: Locations,
    inventory: Inventory
};

const CurrentPageComponent = pages[currentPage];
```

### Mobile-Optimized Navigation
- Button-based navigation instead of Link components
- Active state indicators showing current page
- Smooth page transitions with useState
- Real-time page tracking in UI

### Complete Features Included
- **Dashboard** - Overview cards with booking/staff/location/inventory summaries
- **Bookings Management** - Client scheduling with data tables
- **Staff Management** - Team roster with roles and status
