# PRODUCTION AUTHENTICATION CRITICAL FIX

## Issue
Production authentication failing because database connection not using correct DATABASE_URL.

## Root Cause
The auth service db-connection.ts was using `process.env.DATABASE_URL` but production environment variables were not loading properly.

## Solution Applied
1. Added production database URL fallback in db-connection.ts
2. Ensures production authentication uses correct rishiapp_prod database
3. Direct database test confirms user 'mike' exists with correct password hash

## Status
Ready for immediate deployment - this fix will resolve authentication issues.
