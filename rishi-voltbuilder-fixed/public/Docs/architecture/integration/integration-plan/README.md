# Booking and Events Integration Plan

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive documentation and implementation plan for integrating the Booking and Events/Activities systems within the Rishi Workforce Management platform. The integration establishes a seamless workflow from client booking requests through event execution, staff assignment, logistics coordination, and post-event reporting.

## Primary Documents

1. **[Bookings-Events Integration](bookings-events-integration.md)**

   - Complete architecture plan with current state analysis, future state design, and implementation roadmap
   - Detailed entity relationships, state transitions, and workflow definitions

2. **[Database Schema](database-schema.md)**

   - Detailed database schema design for the integration
   - Entity relationships, table definitions, and constraints

3. **[Event Schema](event-schema.md)**

   - Comprehensive event system schema for booking-event integration
   - Event types, payloads, and routing definitions

4. **[UI Design](ui-design.md)**
   - Detailed wireframes and interface designs for all user roles
   - Implementation approach and phases
   - Design system integration

## Implementation Files

The following implementation files have been created:

1. **[Database Migration Script](implementation/bookings-events-migration.sql)**

   - SQL migration script to implement the database schema changes
   - Creates new tables, modifies existing ones, and establishes relationships

2. **[Drizzle Schema Definition](implementation/events-schema.ts)**

   - TypeScript file defining the Drizzle ORM schema for the new event entities
   - Includes relations, validation schemas, and type definitions

3. **[Service Implementation](implementation/bookings-events-service.ts)**
   - Core service implementation for booking-event integration
   - Handles booking approval, event generation, and lifecycle management

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing this integration, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Database Changes**

   - Always create migrations for schema changes
   - Test with realistic data volumes
   - Preserve existing data integrity

2. **API Development**

   - Follow RESTful design principles
   - Include comprehensive validation
   - Document all endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger

3. **UI Implementation**

   - Ensure responsive design for all interfaces
   - Follow established design system
   - Implement progressive enhancement for reliability

4. **Event System**

   - Ensure type-safety in event definitions
   - Implement idempotent event handlers
   - Include robust error handling and retry mechanisms

5. **Testing Requirements**
   - Maintain 80%+ test coverage
   - Include integration tests for all workflows
   - Create realistic user acceptance testing scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Finalize database schema migration scripts
2. Develop booking approval and event generation API endpoints
3. Implement event handlers for the booking approval workflow
4. Create UI mockups for the booking-to-event transition interfaces
5. Develop and test the initial event instance generation logic
