# Mobile Build Debug Findings

## Test Results So Far

### ✅ Working Tests
1. **Test 1**: Basic HTML - WORKS
2. **Test 2**: HTML + JavaScript - WORKS  
3. **Test 3**: React with state - WORKS

### ❌ Failed Tests
4. **Test 4**: React + React Router - **BLANK PAGE**
   - **Issue**: React Router DOM library causes blank screen
   - **Hypothesis**: Module loading or routing initialization fails in WebView

## Key Discovery

**React Router breaks mobile WebView!** This is critical because the Rishi Platform uses Next.js routing which has similar complexity.

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Debug with Android Studio
- **Pros**: Full device logs, WebView console, network inspection
- **Cons**: Requires setup time, learning curve

### Option 2: Continue Systematic Testing (Recommended)
- **Test 4B**: React with simple state-based routing (no libraries)
- **Test 7**: Next.js static export with debug logging
- **Purpose**: Isolate if it's routing libraries or Next.js itself

### Option 3: Fix Full App Based on Discovery
Since we know routing is an issue, we could:
1. Build Rishi Platform with simplified routing
2. Use hash-based routing instead of browser routing
3. Create mobile-specific navigation

## Android Studio Setup (If Needed)

```bash
# 1. Install Android Studio
# 2. Open APK from VoltBuilder
# 3. Connect device with USB debugging
# 4. View logs: adb logcat | grep chromium
```

## Recommended Next Step

Try **Test 4B** (router-debug) first - it has extensive logging and uses state-based routing instead of React Router. This will tell us if:
- Simple routing works (issue is with React Router specifically)
- All routing fails (deeper WebView issue)

The debug console at the bottom of the screen will show exactly what's happening.
