# PRODUCTION AUTHENTICATION FIX

## Root Cause Analysis
1. ✅ Database connection is working
2. ✅ User 'mike' exists in production database
3. ✅ Password hash verification works correctly
4. ❌ Production authentication still failing

## Database Schema Analysis
Production database uses:
- `full_name` (snake_case)
- `created_at` (snake_case)
- `updated_at` (snake_case)

Code may be expecting:
- `fullName` (camelCase)
- `createdAt` (camelCase)
- `updatedAt` (camelCase)

## Next Steps
1. Check schema.ts for field name mismatches
2. Add detailed logging to user repository
3. Deploy with enhanced debugging
4. Test authentication again

## Status
Investigating schema field name mismatch between database and code.
