# Field Manager RBAC - Territory-Focused Access Control

## Access Philosophy
Field Managers are first-line managers responsible for their assigned territories and brand agent teams. They need management capabilities within their scope but not executive-level access.

## Appropriate Field Manager Access

### ✅ **Team Management (Territory-Focused)**
- **My Brand Agents**: Manage assigned brand agents in their territory
- **Team Schedule**: Schedule management for their team members
- **Team Availability**: Manage availability for their assigned agents

### ✅ **Territory Operations**
- **Territory Bookings**: View and manage bookings within assigned territory
- **Assigned Locations**: Manage locations within their territory
- **Territory Tasks**: Assign and track tasks for their team

### ✅ **Operational Inventory**
- **Kit Templates**: Access standard kit configurations
- **Kit Assignments**: Manage kit distribution to their team

### ✅ **Territory Reporting**
- **Territory Reports**: Performance and operational reports for their area
- First-line management metrics and KPIs
- Team performance tracking

## ❌ **Restricted Access (Executive/High-Level)**

### Organizational Management
- Cross-territory operations
- Organization-wide analytics
- Platform administration
- System configuration

### Financial/Business
- Billing and financial management
- Executive reporting
- Strategic planning tools

### User Administration
- Role and permission management
- User creation (except within territory)
- System-wide settings

### Global Operations
- Multi-territory coordination
- Executive dashboard access
- Company-wide analytics

## Territory Boundaries
- Field Managers can only see data within their assigned territories
- Cannot view or manage other territories' teams or operations
- Have read-only access to company-wide standards and templates
- Can escalate issues to Internal Admins when needed

## Security Model
- **Scope**: Territory-limited access control
- **Principle**: First-line management within assigned boundaries
- **Escalation Path**: Internal Admin for cross-territory or executive issues
- **Data Isolation**: Territory-specific data visibility only

This ensures Field Managers have the tools they need for effective team and territory management while maintaining proper organizational hierarchy and data security.
