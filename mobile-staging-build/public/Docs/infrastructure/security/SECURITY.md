# Google Maps API Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security considerations and best practices for the Google Maps API integration in the Rishi platform.

## API Key Management

### Key Types and Restrictions

The Rishi platform uses two types of API keys:

1. **Server-side API Key**

   - Used for: Geocoding API, Places API, and other server-side requests
   - Protection: Never exposed to client, only used in server-side API routes
   - Restrictions: IP address restrictions to Rishi servers

2. **Client-side API Key**
   - Used for: Maps JavaScript API
   - Protection: Domain and referrer restrictions, usage quotas
   - Environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`

### Restriction Setup

All Google Maps API keys should have the following restrictions:

1. **Application Restrictions**

   - Server key: IP addresses (Rishi production servers)
   - Client key: HTTP referrers (allowed domains)

2. **API Restrictions**
   - Server key: Geocoding API, Places API, Directions API
   - Client key: Maps JavaScript API only

### Key Rotation Policy

- Keys should be rotated every 6 months
- Emergency rotation process in case of suspected compromise
- Old keys must be invalidated after rotation is complete

## Content Security Policy

The application implements a Content Security Policy that allows only the necessary Google domains:

```
connect-src: 'self' *.googleapis.com
script-src: 'self' *.googleapis.com *.gstatic.com
img-src: 'self' *.googleapis.com *.gstatic.com
font-src: 'self' *.gstatic.com
```

This prevents unauthorized script execution and resource loading.

## Data Protection

### PII Handling

When working with location data that may contain personally identifiable information (PII):

1. Store only the minimum necessary location data
2. Apply appropriate access controls based on RBAC
3. Implement data retention policies for location history

### Data Transmission

All location data is transmitted securely:

1. HTTPS for all API requests
2. No sensitive data in URL parameters
3. POST requests for sensitive operations

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Usage Monitoring

The platform monitors Google Maps API usage to:

1. Detect unusual patterns that may indicate abuse
2. Prevent quota exhaustion and billing surprises
3. Identify optimization opportunities

### Security Alerts

Security monitoring is in place for:

1. Unusual geographic access patterns
2. API key usage from unexpected referrers
3. Rate limit violations

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident related to Maps API usage:

1. Immediately revoke compromised API keys
2. Rotate to backup keys
3. Investigate source of compromise
4. Implement additional restrictions as needed

## Developer Guidelines

All developers working with the Google Maps integration must follow these guidelines:

1. Never hardcode API keys in source code
2. Always use environment variables for key storage
3. Use the provided server-side API routes instead of direct API calls
4. Follow the documented loading patterns that maintain CSP compliance
5. Test with restricted API keys, not production keys
6. Report any security concerns immediately

## Compliance

The Maps integration is designed to comply with:

1. Google Maps Platform Terms of Service
2. GDPR requirements for location data
3. Industry standard security practices

Regular security reviews ensure ongoing compliance with these requirements.
