## Environment Strategy

The Rishi platform follows a strict environment segregation strategy to ensure:

1. Development is streamlined with mock data for faster iteration
2. Staging provides a production-like environment with real but isolated data
3. Production remains secure and stable with no test data

For detailed information about environment separation, see the [Environment Segregation](./environment-segregation.md) document.
