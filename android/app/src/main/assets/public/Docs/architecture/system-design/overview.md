# Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of our platform's architecture, explaining the main components and how they interact with each other.

## System Architecture

Our platform is built on a modern, microservices-oriented architecture with the following key components:

### Frontend

- **Next.js**: Server-rendered React framework that provides the user interface
- **React 19**: UI library for building component-based interfaces
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling

### Backend

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the server-side application
- **Express**: Web framework for handling API requests
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for storing structured data
- **Drizzle ORM**: Database toolkit for TypeScript

### Infrastructure

- **Azure Static Web Apps**: Hosting for the frontend
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute for specific workflows
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL database service
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Object storage for files and assets

## Key Design Principles

Our architecture follows these core principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility
2. **API-First Design**: All frontend-backend communication happens through well-defined APIs
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript is used throughout the codebase to ensure type safety
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with client-side features
5. **Responsive Design**: UI adapts to different screen sizes and devices

## Data Flow

The typical data flow in our system is as follows:

1. User interacts with the frontend application in their browser
2. Frontend makes API requests to the backend services
3. Backend services process the request, often interacting with the database
4. Backend returns responses to the frontend
5. Frontend updates the UI based on the response

For real-time features, we use WebSockets to enable bidirectional communication.

## Authentication and Authorization

Our system uses a JWT-based authentication system:

1. User logs in with credentials
2. Backend validates credentials and issues a JWT token
3. Frontend stores the token and includes it in subsequent API requests
4. Backend validates the token for each protected endpoint
5. Role-based access control determines what actions are permitted

## Database Schema

Our database schema is defined using Drizzle ORM and includes these main entities:

- **Users**: User accounts and profiles
- **Items**: The core items managed in the system
- **Categories**: Categorization system for items
- **Transactions**: Records of actions taken on items

For more details, see the [Database Schema Documentation](/docs/architecture/database-schema).

## Deployment Architecture

Our deployment architecture leverages Azure's managed services:

1. Code is hosted in GitHub repositories
2. CI/CD pipelines build and test the application
3. Frontend is deployed to Azure Static Web Apps
4. Backend services are deployed to Azure App Service
5. Database is hosted in Neon's serverless PostgreSQL

## Monitoring and Observability

We use the following tools for monitoring and observability:

- **Application Insights**: For application performance monitoring
- **Log Analytics**: For centralized logging
- **Azure Monitor**: For infrastructure monitoring
- **Custom Dashboards**: For business metrics and KPIs

## System Requirements

The minimum requirements for running the application in production are:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+
- **Node.js**: Version 18+
- **Memory**: 1GB RAM (minimum)
- **Storage**: 10GB (minimum)

## Future Architecture Evolution

We plan to evolve our architecture in the following ways:

1. Moving to a more granular microservices approach
2. Implementing event-driven architecture for specific workflows
3. Adopting Kubernetes for container orchestration
4. Expanding our use of serverless functions
