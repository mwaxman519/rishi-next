# Android Production Release Guide

## Current Status
- ✅ Debug APK successfully built and downloaded
- ✅ All functionality working
- ⚠️ APK named "Rishi Debug" (development build)

## For Production Release APK

### 1. Create Release Keystore
You'll need to generate a keystore file for signing production releases:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore rishi-release-key.keystore -alias rishi -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

### 2. Update voltbuilder.json
Add release configuration:
```json
{
  "platform": "android",
  "build": "release",
  "keystore": "rishi-release-key.keystore",
  "alias": "rishi",
  "storePassword": "YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD",
  "keyPassword": "YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD"
}
```

### 3. Benefits of Release Build
- Smaller APK size (optimized)
- App name becomes "Rishi Platform" (not "Rishi Debug")
- Production-ready performance
- Proper app signing for distribution

## Current Debug APK is Fully Functional
Your current "Rishi Debug" APK includes:
- All workforce management features
- Complete platform functionality
- Native Android performance
- Ready for testing and internal use
