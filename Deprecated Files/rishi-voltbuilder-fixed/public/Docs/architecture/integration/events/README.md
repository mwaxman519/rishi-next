# Event System Architecture

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation about the event-driven architecture implemented in the Rishi Workforce Management platform. The event system is a critical infrastructure component that enables loose coupling between services, real-time updates, and scalable, resilient communication patterns.

- [WebSocket Events](../../events/websocket-events.md) - Documentation for WebSocket-based real-time events
- [Event System Integration](../../events/event-system-integration.md) - How to integrate with the event system
- [Event Types Reference](../../events/event-types-reference.md) - Complete reference of all event types

## Core Components

The event system consists of several key components:

### 1. Event Bus

The Event Bus is the central messaging infrastructure that enables publish/subscribe communication patterns across the application. It supports both in-process communication and distributed messaging across services.

**Key Features**:

- Multiple implementation strategies (Local, Remote, Hybrid)
- Type-safe event definitions
- Retryable event publishing with exponential backoff
- Event tracing for debugging and monitoring
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous handlers

### 2. Event Types

The system defines a comprehensive set of event types organized by domain:

- **Authentication Events**: User login, logout, registration
- **Booking Events**: Booking creation, updates, approvals
- **Location Events**: Location creation, updates, approvals
- **Staff Events**: Staff assignments, availability changes
- **Notification Events**: Message creation, delivery, reading
- **System Events**: Errors, warnings, metrics

### 3. Event Handlers

Event handlers process specific event types and execute business logic in response:

- **Notification Handlers**: Send emails, in-app notifications
- **Integration Handlers**: Sync data with external systems
- **Audit Handlers**: Log important events for compliance
- **Cache Handlers**: Invalidate or update cached data
- **Workflow Handlers**: Trigger workflow state transitions

### 4. WebSocket Integration

The event system integrates with WebSocket technology to enable real-time updates to clients:

- Browser clients connect via WebSocket
- Server publishes relevant events to connected clients
- Clients update UI in response to events
- Reconnection and recovery mechanisms

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Multiple Event Bus Implementations

The system provides different event bus implementations to support various deployment scenarios:

- **LocalEventBus**: Optimized for monolithic deployment with in-memory message passing
- **RemoteEventBus**: Supports distributed deployment with HTTP-based message passing
- **HybridEventBus**: Combines local and remote messaging for transition periods

### 2. Type Safety

The event system uses TypeScript's type system to ensure type safety:

- Event types are defined as an enum
- Event payloads are mapped to their respective types
- Handlers receive strongly-typed payloads
- The compiler catches type mismatches at build time

### 3. Resilience Patterns

The event system implements several resilience patterns:

- **Retry with Exponential Backoff**: Failed publishes are retried with increasing delays
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures when downstream services are unhealthy
- **Dead Letter Queue**: (Planned) Captures events that cannot be processed
- **Event Sourcing**: Critical workflows store all events for replay and recovery

## Usage Patterns

### Publishing Events

```typescript
import { eventBus } from "@/app/services/event-bus";
import { AppEvent } from "@/shared/events";

// Publish an event
await eventBus.publish(AppEvent.BOOKING_CREATED, {
  bookingId: "123",
  clientId: "456",
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

### Subscribing to Events

```typescript
import { eventBus } from "@/app/services/event-bus";
import { AppEvent } from "@/shared/events";

// Subscribe to an event
eventBus.subscribe(AppEvent.BOOKING_CREATED, async (payload) => {
  console.log(`Booking ${payload.bookingId} created`);
  // Handle the event
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Events Meaningful**: Design events to represent significant state changes in the system
2. **Right-Size Event Payloads**: Include enough data for handlers to process the event without fetching
3. **Idempotent Handlers**: Design handlers to be idempotent (can be executed multiple times safely)
4. **Domain-Driven Events**: Align event definitions with domain concepts
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in event handlers
6. **Performance Considerations**: Be mindful of the performance impact of event processing

## Future Roadmap

1. Complete the Event Schema Registry with Zod validation
2. Enhance the Event Dashboard with real-time monitoring
3. Implement the Dead Letter Queue for failed events
4. Develop Event Migration Tools for schema evolution
5. Add more sophisticated event routing based on context
