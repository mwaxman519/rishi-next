## Legacy Documentation (For Removal/Archive)

### Obsolete Technical Guides

- `development-guides/hydration-issues-nextjs.md` - ‚úÖ REMOVED (Fixed in current system)
- `development-guides/chunk-error-fixes.md` - ‚úÖ REMOVED (Webpack issues resolved)
- Files containing outdated webpack configuration issues
- Files referencing old NotificationProvider patterns
- Outdated build optimization guides that are no longer relevant

### Obsolete Feature Documentation

- Any references to "Submit Reports" functionality (replaced with Event Data)
- Outdated calendar implementation guides (superseded by current system)
- Legacy authentication patterns (replaced with current RBAC)

### Redundant Architecture Documents

- Multiple overlapping microservices guides (consolidated into current architecture docs)
- Outdated database schema documents (superseded by current schema integration)
- Legacy deployment guides for deprecated platforms

## Documentation Maintenance Actions Required

### Immediate Cleanup

1. Remove all files related to resolved webpack/hydration issues
2. Archive or remove redundant microservices documentation
3. Clean up obsolete deployment guides
4. Remove outdated feature implementation guides

### Content Updates Needed

1. Update architecture documents to reflect current Event Data and Task Management systems
2. Consolidate overlapping API documentation
3. Update deployment guides to reflect current Azure/Neon configuration
4. Ensure all feature documentation reflects current implementation

### Organization Improvements

1. Consolidate related documentation into clear categories
2. Remove duplicate content across multiple files
3. Create clear cross-references between related documents
4. Establish single source of truth for each system component

## Current Documentation Health

### Well-Maintained Sections ‚úÖ

- Event Data Management System documentation
- Task Management System documentation
- Database Schema Integration
- API Routes Integration
- Current system status verification

### Sections Needing Cleanup ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Architecture documentation (multiple overlapping files)
- Development guides (mix of current and obsolete)
