### Step 2: Build Your Web App (2 minutes)

```

### Step 4: Open in Android Studio (1 minute)
```bash
npx cap open android
```
This opens your project in Android Studio

1. **Wait** - Android Studio will sync for 2-3 minutes (progress bar at bottom)
2. **Click "Build" menu** at the top
3. **Click "Generate Signed Bundle / APK"**
4. **Select "APK"** radio button and click "Next"
5. **Click "Create new..."** to make a keystore:
   - Key store path: Click folder icon, save anywhere (like Desktop)
   - Password: Use any password (remember it!)
   - Alias: Type "rishi" or anything
   - Fill other fields with any values
   - Click "OK"
6. **Select "release"** from dropdown
7. **Click "Finish"**
8. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for build to complete

### Step 6: Get Your APK File
