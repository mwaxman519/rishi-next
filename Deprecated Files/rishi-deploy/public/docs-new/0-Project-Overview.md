# Project Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the project architecture, key technologies, and development approach.

## Technology Stack

The project uses the following technologies:

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.2.2
- **UI Library**: React 19.1.0-canary
- **Type System**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Hosting**: Replit and Azure Static Web Apps
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT-based authentication
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Query and Context API

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern, component-based architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend concerns.

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with Next.js, which provides:

- Server-side rendering for improved SEO and performance
- Static site generation for optimal caching
- API routes for backend functionality
- Middleware for authentication and request processing

Key frontend components:

- Layout components for consistent UI structure
- Page components for specific routes
- UI components for reusable interface elements
- Hooks for shared logic
- Context providers for global state

### Backend Architecture

The backend functionality is primarily implemented through:

- Next.js API routes
- Middleware for authentication and request validation
- Database access through Drizzle ORM
- External service integrations

### Database Schema

The database schema is defined in `shared/schema.ts` using Drizzle ORM's schema definition syntax. This provides:

- Type-safe database operations
- Auto-generated TypeScript types
- Schema validation through Zod

## Development Approach

The project follows these development principles:

### Type Safety

Strong emphasis on TypeScript for type safety:

- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Comprehensive type definitions
- Type-safe database operations
- Runtime validation with Zod

### Performance Optimization

Performance is optimized through:

- Server-side rendering for critical pages
- Static generation where appropriate
- Chunk optimization for faster loading
- Database query optimization

### Security

Security measures include:

- JWT-based authentication
- Middleware for route protection
- Input validation for all user inputs
- CSRF protection
- Database query parameterization

### Testing

Testing strategy includes:

- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for API routes
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Deployment Strategy

The application is deployed using:

- Optimized production builds
- Database migration verification
- Environment variable validation
- Health checks for service verification

## Future Development

Planned enhancements include:

- Expanded test coverage
- Performance monitoring
- Advanced caching strategies
- Enhanced analytics integration
