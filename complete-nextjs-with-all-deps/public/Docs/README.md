## Architecture Documentation

### Core Architecture
- **[Current System Architecture](architecture/CURRENT_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Complete system overview
- **[Authentication & RBAC](authentication/RBAC_PERMISSIONS_SYSTEM.md)** - Security and permissions
- **[Database Schema](architecture/database/INVENTORY_KIT_SYSTEM_SCHEMA.md)** - Complete data model

### Business Implementation
- **[Inventory/Kit System](guides/implementation/INVENTORY_KIT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)** - Complete implementation guide
- **[API Routes](api/inventory-kit-system/API_ROUTES_INVENTORY.md)** - Complete API documentation

## Business Model

### Core Workflow
```
1. Rishi + Client create Kit Templates (brand/region specific)
2. Kit Instances deployed to field locations
3. Brand Agents use kits during bookings (consuming items)
4. Consumption tracked and logged automatically
5. Replenishment requests generated and approved
6. New inventory items supplied to replenish kits
```

### Core Staff Equipment (HR Managed)
- Black polo shirts
- Folding tables
- Neoprene tablecloths

### Kit System (Inventory Managed)
- Brand-specific pamphlets and educational materials
- Promotional stickers and materials
- Product samples and giveaways
- Branded swag bags and accessories

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema (8 New Tables)
- `inventory_items` - Items available for kits
- `kit_templates` - Brand + region specific templates
- `kit_template_items` - Items required in each template
- `kit_instances` - Physical kit instances in field
- `kit_instance_items` - Current items in each instance
- `consumption_logs` - Track consumption during bookings
- `replenishment_requests` - Request workflow for restocking
- `replenishment_request_items` - Specific items to replenish

### Service Architecture
- **InventoryService** - Inventory management
- **KitTemplateService** - Template management
- **KitInstanceService** - Instance tracking
- **ConsumptionService** - Consumption logging
- **ReplenishmentService** - Replenishment workflow
- **EventBusService** - Event publishing with UUID correlation

### API Routes (Complete Implementation)
- `/api/inventory/*` - Inventory management
- `/api/kit-templates/*` - Template management
- `/api/kit-instances/*` - Instance tracking
- `/api/consumption/*` - Consumption logging
- `/api/replenishment/*` - Replenishment workflow
- `/api/analytics/*` - Analytics and reporting

## Authentication & Security

### Role-Based Access Control
- **super_admin** - Platform administration
- **internal_admin** - Rishi operations
- **internal_field_manager** - Regional management
- **brand_agent** - Field operations
- **client_manager** - Client organization management  
- **client_user** - Basic client access

### New Permissions (15+ Added)
- `create:inventory` - Create inventory items
- `manage:kits` - Full kit management
- `log:consumption` - Log consumption events
- `approve:replenishment-requests` - Approve replenishment
- `view:analytics` - View analytics dashboards
- And many more...

## Navigation Updates

### Changes Made
- ✅ Removed `/clients/organizations` routes (each client is one organization)
- ✅ Added PermissionGuard to `/admin/organizations` page
- ✅ Enhanced navigation with new inventory/kit sections
- ✅ Proper permission-based navigation filtering

## Development Guidelines

### Architectural Compliance
- ✅ Next.js serverless foundation
- ✅ Microservices service layer
- ✅ Event bus integration
- ✅ UUID correlation tracking
- ✅ Proper authentication middleware
- ✅ Business model implementation

### Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode
- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- TanStack Query for client state
- Shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Jest for testing

## Deployment

### Environment Strategy
- **Development**: Replit workspace (local)
- **Staging**: Replit Autoscale (testing)
- **Production**: Vercel/Azure (static export)

### Database Strategy
- **Development**: `rishinext_dev`
- **Staging**: `rishinext_staging`
- **Production**: `rishinext`

### Current Status
- ✅ Schema designed and documented
- ✅ Service layer implemented
- ✅ API routes created
- ✅ Authentication system working
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ⏳ Database migration pending
- ⏳ UI implementation pending

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Service layer tests
- Permission system tests
- Database operation tests
- Event publishing tests

### Integration Testing
- API route tests
- Authentication flow tests
- Database constraint tests
- End-to-end workflow tests

## Getting Started

### For Developers
1. Read [Current System Architecture](architecture/CURRENT_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. Review [Implementation Guide](guides/implementation/INVENTORY_KIT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
3. Study [API Documentation](api/inventory-kit-system/API_ROUTES_INVENTORY.md)
4. Check [RBAC System](authentication/RBAC_PERMISSIONS_SYSTEM.md)

### For Administrators
1. Review business model implementation
2. Understand role-based permissions
3. Learn kit template creation process
4. Study replenishment workflow
