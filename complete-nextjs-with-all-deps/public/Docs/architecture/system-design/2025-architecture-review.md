# 2025 Architecture Review and Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of our platform's architecture as of March 2025, focusing on two critical architectural components:

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Our implementation of a sophisticated event system that enables loosely coupled communication between services.
2. **Mobile Architecture**: Our offline-first mobile application architecture that enables field operations in challenging connectivity environments.

Both architectural components have reached production maturity with robust implementations that have been thoroughly tested and validated through real-world usage.

## Event-Driven Architecture Review

### Current Implementation

Our event-driven architecture has been successfully implemented using a tiered approach that enables flexibility and scalability:

1. **Core Event System**

   - Type-safe event definitions using TypeScript
   - Domain-driven event naming conventions
   - Comprehensive payload typing and validation

2. **Three-Tier Event Bus**

   - `LocalEventBus`: In-memory event handling for monolith stage
   - `RemoteEventBus`: HTTP-based distributed events for microservices
   - `HybridEventBus`: Transitional implementation combining both approaches

3. **Advanced Event Patterns**
   - Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) for high-traffic operations
   - Event Sourcing for critical financial and compliance workflows
   - Event tracing and monitoring for observability

### Business Benefits Realized

The event-driven architecture has delivered significant benefits:

1. **Increased Development Agility**

   - Services can be developed and deployed independently
   - New event subscribers can be added without modifying existing code
   - Clearer boundaries between domain concerns

2. **Improved System Resilience**

   - Services continue functioning even if other services are down
   - Graceful degradation during partial system failures
   - Comprehensive error handling and retries for event processing

3. **Enhanced Business Insights**
   - Event streams provide rich data for analytics
   - Full history of system activities through event logs
   - Clear visibility into cross-service workflows

### Mobile Architecture Review

### Current Implementation

Our mobile architecture has been implemented with a strong focus on offline capabilities and synchronization:

1. **Offline-First Data Management**

   - WatermelonDB for local data storage with relational capabilities
   - Sophisticated synchronization protocol for bidirectional sync
   - Multiple conflict resolution strategies by entity type

2. **Core Mobile Services**

   - Authentication with secure token storage and biometrics
   - Camera integration for document capture and verification
   - Location services with geofencing for field operations
   - Push notifications for real-time alerts and updates

3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
   - React Native with Expo for iOS and Android deployment
   - Shared business logic between web and mobile platforms
   - Consistent user experience across all devices

### Business Benefits Realized

The mobile architecture has delivered significant advantages for field operations:

1. **Enhanced Field Productivity**

   - Field agents can work effectively without connectivity
   - All critical operations available offline with automatic sync
   - Reduced data entry errors and duplicate work

2. **Improved Data Quality**

   - Structured data capture with validation
   - Real-time data synchronization when connectivity is available
   - Reduced manual reconciliation and data loss

3. **Operational Visibility**
   - Location tracking and geofencing for field operations
   - Real-time status updates when agents are online
   - Comprehensive reporting on field activities

## Architecture Integration Points

Our event-driven and mobile architectures are designed to work together seamlessly through the following integration points:

1. **Mobile Event Synchronization**

   - Mobile devices participate in the event ecosystem through the sync protocol
   - Local events are queued for delivery to the central event system
   - Critical events from the central system are prioritized for mobile delivery

2. **Shared Domain Model**

   - Consistent entity definitions across web and mobile platforms
   - Shared validation logic and business rules
   - Type-safe interfaces for all data operations

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Unified identity management across platforms
   - JWT-based authentication with consistent claims processing
   - Role-based access control applied consistently
