# 🔧 Vercel Build Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Import Path Corrections
Fixed incorrect path aliases that were causing module resolution errors:

- **app/admin/page.tsx**: Changed `@/shared/features` → `@shared/features`
- **app/components/SidebarLayout.tsx**: Changed `@/shared/navigation-constants` → `@shared/navigation-constants`
- **app/components/SidebarLayout.tsx**: Changed `@/shared/navigation-structure` → `@shared/navigation-structure`
- **app/components/users/UserDetailPanel.tsx**: Changed `@/shared/rbac/roles` → `@shared/rbac/roles`
- **app/components/navigation/SuperAdminNavigation.tsx**: Changed `@/shared/navigation-constants` → `@shared/navigation-constants`

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
The issue was that `@/shared` was trying to resolve to `app/shared`, but the actual shared directory is in the project root. The correct alias is `@shared` which points to the root `shared/` directory.

## 📁 Verified File Structure
```
shared/
├── features/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── registry.ts
├── navigation-constants.ts
├── navigation-structure.tsx
├── rbac/
│   └── roles.ts
└── schema.ts
```

## 🔍 Files Fixed
✅ **All `@/shared` imports** automatically corrected across the entire codebase
✅ **0 remaining files** with incorrect imports (verified)
✅ **Build process** now starts successfully

Key files updated:
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - Features import
