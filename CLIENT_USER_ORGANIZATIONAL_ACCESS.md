# Client User Organizational Access Configuration

## Access Philosophy
Client Users represent the primary users of client organizations and should have comprehensive access to all platform features within their organizational boundaries. They have broader access than Brand Agents or Field Managers but are restricted to their own organization.

## Access Comparison

### Client User vs Other Roles:
- **vs Brand Agent**: Full organizational access vs personal-only access
- **vs Field Manager**: Organization-wide vs territory-limited access
- **vs Internal Admin**: Single organization vs cross-organization access
- **vs Super Admin**: Organization-scoped vs platform-wide access

## Security Model
- **Scope**: Single organization with full feature access
- **Data Isolation**: Organization-specific data visibility
- **Feature Access**: Complete platform functionality within boundaries
- **User Management**: Can manage users within their organization
- **Reporting**: Full analytics and reporting for their organization

This configuration provides Client Users with the comprehensive toolset they need to effectively manage their organization's operations while maintaining proper security boundaries and data isolation.
