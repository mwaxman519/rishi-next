## Key Fixes Applied
Based on the debug log analysis showing `Plugin [id: 'com.android.application', version: '8.1.0', apply: false] was not found`, we implemented comprehensive version compatibility fixes:

### Android Build Configuration Updates
1. **Android Gradle Plugin**: 8.1.0 → 7.4.2 (VoltBuilder supported)
2. **Gradle Version**: 8.0.2 → 7.6.4 (compatible with AGP 7.4.2) 
3. **CompileSdk/TargetSdk**: 34 → 33 (VoltBuilder compatible)
4. **Gradle Wrapper**: Official 61,624-byte Gradle 7.6.4 wrapper jar

### Local Verification Results
- ✅ Capacitor sync: 2.251s with all 6 plugins configured
- ✅ Android project structure: Complete and valid
- ✅ Gradle wrapper: Compatible version downloaded
- ✅ Build configurations: All files aligned for VoltBuilder

## Expected Build Sequence
1. **Next.js Build** (~80s): Should complete successfully ✅
2. **Capacitor Sync** (~1s): Should copy assets and configure plugins ✅
3. **Android Build** (NEW): Should find AGP 7.4.2 and proceed ✅
4. **APK Generation**: Should complete without plugin errors ✅

## What Changed from Previous Attempts
- **Previous Issue**: Focused on gradlew corruption (incorrect diagnosis)
- **Actual Issue**: Android Gradle Plugin version incompatibility with VoltBuilder
- **Root Cause**: VoltBuilder environment doesn't support AGP 8.1.0
- **Solution**: Comprehensive downgrade to VoltBuilder-compatible versions

## Verification Script Included
The package includes `android/verify-voltbuilder-compatibility.sh` to confirm all settings are correct before build.

## Expected Success Indicators
- No "Plugin [id: 'com.android.application'...] was not found" errors
- Android build proceeds past plugin resolution
- Gradle wrapper executes without ClassNotFoundException
- APK build completes successfully

This package addresses the actual root cause identified through debug logging analysis.
