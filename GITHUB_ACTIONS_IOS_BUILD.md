## ðŸš€ SETUP STEPS

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub
1. Create GitHub repository: https://github.com/new
2. Upload your project to GitHub
3. Make sure it's public (for free builds)

### Step 2: Create GitHub Actions Workflow
I'll create the workflow file for you that builds iOS automatically.

### Step 3: Add Apple Developer Secrets
You'll need to add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
- Apple Developer Certificate
- Provisioning Profile
- Certificate Password

### Step 4: Push Code = Automatic Build
Every time you push code, GitHub automatically builds your iOS app.

## ðŸ“± ALTERNATIVE: PWA + App Store Workaround

### Option A: PWA Installation
Your app is already a PWA (Progressive Web App):
1. Users visit your website on iPhone
2. Click "Add to Home Screen"
3. App installs like native app
4. Works offline, has push notifications

### Option B: App Store PWA
1. Use tools like PWABuilder
2. Convert PWA to App Store app
3. Submit to App Store
4. Users get "native" app experience

## ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDED APPROACH

For your situation, I recommend:

1. **Immediate solution**: GitHub Actions for free iOS builds
2. **Long-term solution**: Consider PWA installation (simpler)
3. **Professional solution**: Buy used Mac Mini ($200-400)

## ðŸš¨ NEXT STEPS
