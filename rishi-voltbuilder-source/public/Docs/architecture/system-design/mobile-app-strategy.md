# Mobile App Development Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive strategy for developing a native mobile application for both iOS and Android platforms that extends the capabilities of our existing web application. The mobile app implements an advanced offline-first architecture, allowing field agents to work effectively in areas with poor or no connectivity while seamlessly synchronizing with our serverless backend when connectivity is restored.

This strategy document reflects the latest architectural decisions, implementation approaches, and technology selections as of March 2025.

## Key Requirements

1. **Offline Functionality**

   - Agents must be able to work in areas with poor or no connectivity
   - Data must synchronize when connectivity is restored
   - Critical functions must be available offline
   - Clear indication of sync status to users

2. **Device Integration**

   - Camera access for document scanning and photo uploads
   - Location services for field location tracking and verification
   - Push notifications for important alerts
   - Biometric authentication for secure access

3. **Scalability**

   - Support for 1,000-5,000+ users nationally
   - Efficient data synchronization to minimize bandwidth
   - Optimized battery and storage usage

4. **White-Label Support**
   - Configurable branding elements (logos, colors, etc.)
   - Organization-specific settings and preferences
   - Custom domain support for API endpoints

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Project Structure

We will follow a monorepo architecture to share code between the Next.js web app and React Native mobile app:

```
/
├── app/                  # Next.js web application
├── shared/               # Shared code (types, schemas, utilities)
├── packages/             # Reusable packages
└── apps/
    ├── mobile/           # React Native mobile app
    └── web/              # (Alias to root app directory)
```

### 2. Technology Stack

- **React Native + Expo**: For cross-platform mobile development
- **Watermelon DB**: Local database for offline storage and sync
- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Serverless database (already implemented)
- **Sync API Layer**: Custom sync endpoints for efficient data transfer
- **Drizzle ORM**: For database interaction (already implemented)
- **TypeScript**: For type safety across the codebase
- **React Query**: For data fetching and caching

### 3. Offline Strategy

We'll implement a robust offline-first architecture:

1. **Local Storage**: Watermelon DB for local data persistence
2. **Sync Protocol**:
   - Pull-based synchronization for initial data loading
   - Push-based change tracking for updates
   - Conflict resolution strategies for data collisions
   - Queuing system for pending changes
3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Field-specific resolution strategies
   - Server timestamps as source of truth for most conflicts
   - User intervention only when necessary
   - Automatic merging where possible

### 4. Authentication & Security

- **JWT-based authentication**: Consistent with web app
- **Secure token storage**: Using device secure storage
- **Biometric authentication**: Additional layer of security
- **Data encryption**: For locally stored sensitive information
- **Automatic session expiry**: For security compliance

### 5. API Endpoints

We'll implement these additional endpoints for mobile app support:

- `/api/sync/pull`: For pulling data changes
- `/api/sync/push`: For pushing local changes
- `/api/media/upload`: For camera image uploads
- `/api/auth/refresh`: For refreshing authentication tokens
- `/api/config/brand`: For white-labeling configuration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Setup monorepo structure
- Configure shared types between web and mobile
- Implement basic navigation and screens
- Establish authentication flow

### Phase 2: Core Functionality

- Implement offline storage with Watermelon DB
- Create synchronization services
- Build basic CRUD operations for key entities
- Add camera integration for document uploads

### Phase 3: Offline Features

- Complete offline-first workflow
- Implement conflict resolution strategies
- Add queue management for pending operations
- Create sync status indicators

### Phase 4: White-Labeling & Scaling

- Add organization-specific configuration
- Implement theme customization
- Optimize for performance at scale
- Add analytics and monitoring

### Phase 5: Testing & Refinement

- Cross-device testing
- Stress test with large data sets
- Battery and bandwidth optimization
- Security auditing

## Mobile-Specific Features

### Field Agent Functionality

- **Digital check-in/out**: Using location verification
- **Document scanning**: For compliance documentation
- **Offline availability submissions**: For scheduling
- **Facility map integration**: For navigation assistance
- **Offline time tracking**: For accurate records

### Notifications

- **Push notifications**: For new assignments and urgent updates
- **In-app messaging**: For team communication
- **Sync status alerts**: For data synchronization events

### UI/UX Considerations

- **Offline indicators**: Clear visual cues for sync status
- **Low-bandwidth mode**: For reduced data consumption
- **Progressive loading**: For critical vs. secondary data
- **Error recovery flows**: For handling synchronization issues

## Challenges & Mitigations

| Challenge                 | Mitigation Strategy                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Intermittent connectivity | Queue-based sync with retry mechanisms                                        |
| Data conflicts            | Field-specific resolution strategies with clear user intervention when needed |
| Battery consumption       | Optimized sync intervals and background operations                            |
| Device fragmentation      | Expo managed workflow for consistent cross-platform experience                |
| Large data sets           | Incremental and selective synchronization                                     |

## Conclusion

This mobile app strategy provides a framework for extending our web application to native mobile platforms while ensuring robust offline functionality for field agents. By leveraging a monorepo architecture with shared code and modern tools like Watermelon DB and Expo, we can deliver a high-quality mobile experience that meets the needs of our users working in challenging connectivity environments.
